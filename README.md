## 🎭 The Story Behind "NotTheRealWallyx"

Ever wondered where my username and profile pic come from? It’s a mix of two characters:

- 🕵️ **Wally** (a.k.a. Waldo) from _Where’s Waldo?_ – Always hiding, just like some of my best code. 😆
- 🎤 **2D** from _Gorillaz_ – The lead singer of the iconic band, adding a touch of musical chaos to the mix.

So yeah, if you’re looking for me… good luck finding me. 😜
